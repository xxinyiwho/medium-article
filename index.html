      <h2>And...is this even a question</h3>
      <p>
        that can ask? I know children’s animation isn’t typically a film genre that’s expected to stand up to scientific inquiry, and that’s cool. I’m cool with it.
        But I’ve got a seriously sneaking suspicion that The Lion King tried to hoodwink unsuspecting audiences with some less-than-kosher ecology. Don’t get me wrong, the film is spectacular. It’s been adapted and re-released in dozens of formats to millions of people, and in 2019 we’re finally getting a legit star-studded, semi-live-action reboot. Against all odds, it finally happened.

      <h2>And, yes,</h2>
      <p>
        the movie isn’t supposed to be factual. The characters talk, they scheme, they dance in drag and do the hula. Still, The Lion King flirts with a small handful of scenarios that do indeed dip into real biology, if only for brief moments. Let’s see if there’s any legit science that keeps the film grounded in reality.
        Please, bear with me. This actually gets really cool.
